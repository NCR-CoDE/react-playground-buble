# React Buble Playgrounds

This Lerna repo contains npm packages used to render live evaluation code
playgrounds that use buble to transpile JSX and ES2015. It is lighter weight
than playgrounds that use Babel for transpilation.

* `react-playground-bare`: Helper tool for making playgrounds does not contains
a code editor
* `react-playground-lite`: Playground styled with inline styles and CSS it uses
CodeMirror as a code editor
* `react-playground-styled`: Playground styled using `styled-components` with
CodeMirror as a code editor

For more details see individual projects in the packages folder.
